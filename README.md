# Sparvi
An open-source data quality and profiling engine for modern data warehouses. Sparvi monitors data pipelines, detects anomalies, tracks schema changes, and ensures data integrity with sharp precisionâ€”like a hawk keeping watch over your data.

This repository contains both the backend (Flask API with a data profiler) and the frontend (React) for the HawkDB Data Profiler MVP.

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the Flask app:

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the React app:

The React app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect to the backend API for profiling data.

## Security and Configuration

- Store sensitive credentials using environment variables or a secret management system.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Customize API endpoints and CORS policies as needed.
